# Day 3 — Reading and Cleaning Raw Data
Student Data Cleaning & Evaluation Pipeline

This project simulates a real-world data preprocessing task
commonly required before Machine Learning or analytics workflows

## Features:
- Handles missing and corrupted data
- Converts raw text into structured information
- Computes aggregate metrics (average score)
- Applies rule-based decision logic


## Why this matters:
In real ML systems, raw data is messy.
Models fail without proper preprocessing.
This script focuses on data quality, not just algorithms.

## Key takeaway
Most data work happens before any analysis or modeling.
